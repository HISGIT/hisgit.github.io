I’m feeling really upset inside and need some kind of release.

Before getting off work, three or four ideas flowed through my mind one by one.

Fire up my brain for a round, keep grinding away to finish the blog, and push out the second post faster. That was the first thing that popped into my head.

Or enjoy whith myself, even having already picked out a novel excerpt in ready. The second idea.

Or gaming, walk around in Animal Crossing with using the newly arrived big screen, keep challenging Silksong. The third.

And finally, pick a nearby theater and have a random encounter with a movie. The fourth.

But instinctively, almost subconsciously, I realized that aside from the first option, all the others would only bring sensory pleasure.  
The frustration in my heart would still remain—like coffee residue left at the bottom of a cup after it’s been drained,  
accumulating more and more, the more I thought about it, the worse it felt.

While having dinner, I thought through those options again, and in the end, I finally decided to go back and finish the blog.

As for what kind of pros-and-cons comparison actually happened in the background of my mind, I don’t feel like digging into it for now.

The result was exactly as expected: writing the blog really did bring a deep sense of psychological satisfaction, like giving my mind a full spa treatment.

It felt like driving an off-road vehicle down a deserted country road.  
The first time driving, no map, no navigation, no co-driver—chugging along, crawling forward at a snail’s pace.  
The second time, with the familiarity and caution from the first run, I floored the accelerator.

The scenery I had no time to appreciate before could now be enjoyed calmly, even while drifting through corners.
The bumps and potholes in the road, once filtered through the suspension, felt like a gentle sway—almost like a train rounding a bend.

Brushing past roadblocks in a thrilling, heart-pounding moment became nothing more than a small milestone upon reaching the destination.  
We know that as long as we keep moving forward, we’ll pass a hundred more, a thousand more, and eventually arrive at the end.

Whether happy or frustrated, recording how I feel at this moment is exactly  
That way we make it and again.
